Application Overview:
1. Authentication via Google OAuth provides personalized trip dashboards and session-based access control.
2. Trip management allows owners to create journeys, auto-enroll themselves as owner members, invite companions, and manage collaborative budgets and spending.
3. Expense tracking supports categorization, shared budget entries, and analytics visualizations for group reconciliation.

Automated Checks:
- npm run check: Passed (TypeScript compilation succeeded).
- npm run build: Passed with warnings about outdated Browserslist data, missing PostCSS from option, and oversized bundles.

Warnings and Errors:
- Warning: Browserslist data is 13 months old; run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` to refresh targeting data.
- Warning: A PostCSS plugin is missing the `from` option, which can break asset transforms.
- Warning: Several bundles exceed 500 kB after minification, indicating potential performance issues on slow networks.

Recommended Improvements:
1. Update Browserslist data and ensure CI refreshes it regularly.
2. Audit custom PostCSS plugins to supply the `from` option or replace offenders.
3. Introduce additional code splitting or manual chunking to keep critical bundles under 500 kB.
