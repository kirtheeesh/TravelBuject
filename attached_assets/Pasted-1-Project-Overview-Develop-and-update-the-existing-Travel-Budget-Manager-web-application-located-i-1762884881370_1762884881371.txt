1. Project Overview
Develop and update the existing Travel Budget Manager web application located in the current directory. The objective is to introduce an internal chatbot interface that automates all existing manual dashboard operations using selectable chat-based interactions, without integrating OpenAI or any external AI APIs.

2. Purpose
The chatbot will enable users to perform all app operations directly from a guided, interactive chat interface on the dashboard, simplifying user actions such as adding a budget, deleting budgets, adding spendings, checking balances, and inviting members.

3. Scope
Update the existing Travel Budget Manager web application.

Implement a chatbot system present on the dashboard that:

Displays when a trip has been created.

Interacts through predefined selectable chat messages.

Executes corresponding actions within the app (no free-text input).

Redirects users to specific pages after operations.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Chatbot Visibility

The chatbot component becomes visible only when a user has created a trip.

It appears on the dashboard as a clickable icon or button.

4.2 Chat Interaction Flow

When the user clicks the chatbot, a predefined message sequence begins.

Chatbot prompts example options:

“Want to add budget”

“Want to delete budget”

“Want to add spending”

“Want to know balance”

“Want to invite members”

The user cannot manually type messages; only clickable choices are displayed.

4.3 Chatbot Actions
Each selectable message triggers a specific function:

“Add budget” → Opens or executes the add budget module already implemented.

“Delete budget” → Opens the delete budget functionality.

“Add spending” → Opens the add spending interface.

“Know balance” → Displays the calculated remaining balance.

“Invite member” → Opens the invite member popup/module.

4.4 Page Navigation

Whenever the chatbot triggers an operation that requires manual entry or detailed view, it should:

Redirect the user automatically to the appropriate page (e.g., spending page, budget page).

Maintain context awareness of the current trip.

4.5 No External AI Models

Do not use OpenAI or any third-party APIs.

Logic should rely on existing backend data, application state, and internal control flow.

4.6 Data Handling

Use existing data from the current application directory and APIs.

The chatbot should read and manipulate data through existing services or controllers.

5. Technical Requirements
Frontend: Existing stack (likely React, Angular, or similar) to build chatbot UI.

Backend: Use current backend logic (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python, etc.).

Database: Reuse existing database connections and schemas.

The chatbot system must integrate without breaking existing routes, state, or UI components.

Add modular code so chatbot can be toggled or extended in future.

6. User Experience
Chatbox fixed at bottom-right corner of the dashboard.

Smooth transitions between chatbot prompts and navigation.

Clear messages confirming each completed operation.

Minimal interface distraction from main dashboard view.

7. Validation and Testing
Ensure each chatbot option executes the same logic as the manual option.

Test that all redirects land the user on the correct pages.

Validate all data modifications post-chatbot actions.

Confirm chatbot never allows arbitrary user text input.

8. Constraints
Must work entirely offline with local or existing project data.

Must not break existing manual operations (they should still function).

Must follow same design pattern as current application.
