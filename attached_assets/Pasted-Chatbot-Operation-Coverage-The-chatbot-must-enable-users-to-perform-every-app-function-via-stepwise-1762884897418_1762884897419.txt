Chatbot Operation Coverage
The chatbot must enable users to perform every app function via stepwise, click-based interactions. For each operation, users only interact by selecting options—there is no free-text input.

The chatbot must support the following actions:

Budget Management

Add a new budget for the trip

Edit or update an existing budget

Delete a budget entry

View all budgets for the trip

Spending Management

Add a new spending record (select category, amount, etc.)

Edit an existing spending entry

Delete a spending entry

View all spending records

Balance and Reports

Display remaining trip balance

Show detailed spending reports (daily, category-wise)

Export or view expense summaries

Member Management

Invite new members to the trip

Remove members from the trip

View list of trip participants

Trip Controls

Edit trip details (name, dates, destination)

Delete an existing trip

Switch/select between multiple trips

Navigation

Redirect to relevant pages (budgets, spendings, overview, members) after a user confirms an action or chooses to view details

Allow returning to the previous chat menu or dashboard at any stage

Confirmation and Feedback

Confirm before executing destructive actions (e.g., deletions)

Display success, error, or info messages as chat bubbles after each action

Interaction Example:

User clicks the chatbot on the dashboard.

Chatbot greets and shows all main options (Add Budget, View Spendings, Invite Member, etc.).

User selects “Add Spending.”

Chatbot presents step-by-step options (choose category, enter amount, select member).

On completion, chatbot confirms the addition and offers navigation or next steps.

Implementation Notes
Every manual operation available in the app must have a corresponding chatbot interaction, fully automating the process.

The chatbot interface should be easily updatable to add future operations.

All logic runs locally, reusing application services, controllers, and data without external APIs.
