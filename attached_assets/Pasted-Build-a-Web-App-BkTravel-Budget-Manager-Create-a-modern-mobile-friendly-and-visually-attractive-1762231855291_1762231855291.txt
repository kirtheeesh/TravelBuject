Build a Web App – BkTravel Budget Manager
Create a modern, mobile-friendly, and visually attractive web application called “BkTravel Budget Manager” using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, CSS, and Firebase as the backend database. Focus on intuitive UI/UX design that is easy for all users to understand and interact with. Please implement the following screens and features:

1. Splash Page
Purpose: Welcome users to BkTravel Budget Manager.

Features:

Visually appealing layout using travel imagery or illustrations.

Application logo and a short, catchy tagline (e.g., “Plan, Track & Split Your Travel Budget Effortlessly!”).

Prominent button to “Create Budget”.

2. Budget Creation Flow (Splash & Home)
From Splash Page: Clicking “Create Budget” leads to budget creation form.

Form Fields:

Trip Name: User inputs the trip/holiday’s name.

Total Members: User enters number of participants.

Assign Member Names: Input fields are dynamically created based on total members; user provides each member’s name.

Add Budget Items: Section lets users add multiple expenses/categories (e.g., Tea, Coffee, Accommodation, Alcohol, Transport, Food, Miscellaneous).

For each item, user specifies the amount and picks which members are included in the split via checkboxes (each member shown with their inputted name).

Amount is split equally among selected members.

“Add More” button for adding multiple budget items (each as a separate row/component).

Save Button: After details are filled, user can save the budget to the database (Firebase).

3. Home Page
Features:

Lists all budgeted trips the user has created, each shown as a card with trip name and summary.

Two main actions: “Create Budget” (again) and “View Dashboard.”

“Profile” section with user information (Google email, profile pic, etc.).

4. Dashboard Page
Features:

Clicking any trip card from the Home opens the Dashboard for that trip.

Shows a history table/timeline of all budget entries for that trip.

Real-time notifications if a new budget item is added (“Budget Added: [item name], Amount: [amount]”).

Data should be visually summarized (pie chart/bar graph for easy split visualization if possible).

“Back to Home” and “Add More Budget” buttons.

5. Authentication
Login Requirement:

After a budget is created or on app entry, require users to log in with Google for full access.

Use Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In only).

Show authentication button on all relevant screens if not logged in.

6. General UI/UX
Clean, playful, and modern look with vibrant colors.

Responsive design: works great on mobile and desktop.

Simple navigation and onboard tooltips for first-time users.

Consistent header/footer and icon use.

7. Technology Stack
Frontend: React (with TypeScript), CSS (or CSS-in-JS), optional: Material UI or similar for faster UI.

Backend: Node.js, Express (for API endpoints if needed).

Database/Auth: Firebase (Firestore for data, Firebase Auth for Google sign-in).

Use the following Firebase config:

typescript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCBckiUnyFrM9B9rYmuZ_ML_U33VGyuyQY",
  authDomain: "travelbudject.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "travelbudject",
  storageBucket: "travelbudject.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "103530764597",
  appId: "1:103530764597:web:a0342b2970fc6af951947c",
  measurementId: "G-CK7BE9REQ4"
};
// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
Notes for the AI:
Generate React components with proper state handling.

Show clear user flows for each screen.

Add helpful comments in the code for clarity.

Include form validation for budget creation.

Data should be securely stored in Firestore according to user login (each user only sees their trips).

Ensure every design aspect is friendly for first-timers and has clear feedback for every action.

Suggest creative ways to keep users engaged (like displaying avatars for members, using color-coded expense types, etc).
